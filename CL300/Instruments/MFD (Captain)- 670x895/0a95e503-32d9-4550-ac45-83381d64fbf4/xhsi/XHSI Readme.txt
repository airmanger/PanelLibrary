Configuring XHSI for the Challenger cockpit:
--------------------------------------------
Copy XHSI2.exe to a new directory
Copy the appropriate config file to that directory and rename it to XHSI.properties
Start XHSI
Set the correct AptNav directory
Optionally configure the UDP port
Optionally adjust window positions (espically if you have more than on screen)
Restart XHSI

In X-Plane (once for all instances):
Configure the hostname(s) and ports for all instances in the plugin configuration.
